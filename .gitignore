# General log files.
# psi_errors.log is transient during the workflow run.
# Specific run logs are archived to data/psi_error_reports/psi_errors_<run_id>.log and committed by the workflow.
*.log
!psi_errors.log # Keep if needed by any local script, though workflow copies it.

# DO NOT ignore data/psi_error_reports/ as the workflow commits its contents.
# DO NOT ignore psi_errors.log at the root if it's used by error reporting before being moved/archived.
# However, the workflow copies psi_errors.log to data/psi_error_reports/ and then deletes the root one.
# So, ignoring *.log but NOT data/psi_error_reports/ is correct.
# And psi_errors.log itself at the root is temporary during a run.
# data/psi_processing_state.json IS committed.
# TODO.md IS committed.
